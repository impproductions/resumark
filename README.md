# Resumark

This is a weekend project I created because I needed to update my resume and I couldn't find any subscription-free, hassle-free editors online, and I don't have Word, and I don't like the templates in Pages, and I'm too lazy to find a solution, and I like writing code, not moving stuff around on a text editor or spend the day choosing a font, and so here we are.

## How it works

I decided to leverage one of the greatest inventions of our time: the Markdown language. This thing is basically just Markdown, extended with a couple of additional goodies for quality of life.

## FAQ

## How to use

## Current (and forever) limitations

-   There is no concept of pages: either your resume fits in an A4 sheet, or you're out of luck
-   No UI: the resume is defined by the text you write and that's it
-   Storage: the resume is stored in your local storage as a text file. If you're using the application in incognito mode or you clear application data you _will_ lose it

## This sucks, are there better alternatives?

Yes! While frantically working on this to fit it in a busy weekend, I realised I might not be exactly pioneering the concept of "using a slightly extended version of markdown for a specific application", so I did some research and stumbled upon [Resumey](https://resumey.pro).
If you like the concept of ResuMark and wish someone actually made it happen, I would highly recommend you to use that and never look back! I'm not affiliated, I'm just a fan.
